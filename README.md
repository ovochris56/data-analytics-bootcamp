# Data Analytics Bootcamp Coursework

Welcome to my repository for the Data Analytics Bootcamp! This repo contains assignments, projects, and notebooks that I developed throughout the bootcamp, which took place from July-November 2024. It covers topics such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using Python and various data analytics libraries.
